            Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) is a minimally
            invasive procedure to replace a narrowed aortic valve that restricts
            blood flow, a condition known as aortic stenosis. This life-saving
            procedure offers an alternative to traditional open-heart surgery,
            using a catheter-based technique to implant a new valve without the
            need for large surgical incisions.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-start font-light">
            TAVR is especially beneficial for patients who are at high risk or
            unsuitable for open-heart surgery. The procedure alleviates symptoms
            like chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue, improving both
            heart function and quality of life.

            It is sometimes referred to as Transcatheter Aortic Valve
            Implantation (TAVI).
