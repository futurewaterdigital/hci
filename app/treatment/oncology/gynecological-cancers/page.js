    "Gynecological cancers encompass a group of malignancies affecting a womanâ€™s reproductive organs, including cervical, ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and vulvar cancers. Each type has unique symptoms, risk factors, and treatment options, but early detection is key to improving outcomes across all forms. Common risk factors include age, family history, genetic mutations like BRCA1/BRCA2, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity. Advances in screening, such as Pap smears for cervical cancer, along with diagnostic tools like ultrasound and genetic testing, have greatly aided in early diagnosis. Treatment approaches, which may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, are tailored to the specific type and stage of the cancer.",
