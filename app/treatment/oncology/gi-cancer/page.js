        Bowel cancer or Colorectal cancer, which originates in the colon or

        India. Although it primarily affects individuals over the age of 50, it
        can also occur in younger people due to a combination of dietary habits,
        lifestyle factors, and genetic predispositions. As cases rise in India,
        especially with changing food patterns and urban lifestyles, early
        detection and comprehensive treatment remain essential for better
