  description:
    "Oesophagus cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the long, hollow tube connecting the throat to the stomach, known as the oesophagus. It plays a key role in moving food from the mouth to the stomach for digestion. This type of cancer often begins in the cells lining the oesophagus and can spread to other parts of the body if not treated early. It is one of the leading types of cancers in India, particularly affecting individuals over the age of 50, with lifestyle factors and dietary habits contributing significantly to its risk.",
