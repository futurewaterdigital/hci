          Healthcare organisations joining hands with HCI can benefit in more
          ways than one. Considering that we are a reputed and fast expanding
          facilitator of medical tourism, partners could leverage our equity
          effectively to deliver services to patients from across geographies.
          They can also have access to information on the latest in equipment,
          processes and expertise, leveraging our ecosystem.
